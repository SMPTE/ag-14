    <h2>Participation Agreement</h2>

<pre>

By submitting this application I understand:

  • That on approval of my application I will be permitted to join any number of SMPTE Technology 
    Committees and their subgroups;
  • That my initial status on each Technology Committee will be that of Observer Member, 
    but that after attending one or more meetings I may apply to the Technology Committee Chair 
    for Participant Member status on that Technology Committee;
  • That Participant Membership in any Technology Committee requires regular attendance at meetings
    and regular articipation in formal ballots of the committee;
  • That membership of the SMPTE Standards Community requires a single working email address for 
    all committee communications, and access to the Internet for obtaining documents, participation 
    in committee ballots, etc.

I acknowledge and agree:

  • To be governed by the SMPTE Bylaws
  • That I will adhere to the provisions of the SMPTE Operations Manuals applicable to Engineering 
    Committees (available at https://www.smpte.org/about/policies-and-governance), specifically 
    the SMPTE Standards Operations Manual and the Intellectual Property Policy included therein 
    and, following notification of any adoption or change, such rules and policies as the Board of 
    Directors and/or the SMPTE Standards Committee may from time to time adopt.
  • That on-going participation in Committee activities constitutes an agreement to be bound by any 
    amendment(s) in SMPTE Bylaws, SMPTE Standards Operations Manual, rules and/or policies that
    are made from time to time. Such adoptions, amendments and changes in policies will be communicated 
    to me by email to the address I provide for Committee communications at least 30 days before the 
    effective date of the change.
  • That I may be participating in issues relating to the on-going appraisal of technologies, and in 
    decisions that are interim by nature and may undergo substantial revisions. I recognize that SMPTE 
    encourages me to discuss such issues privately with others considered to be knowledgeable in the 
    field. However, since premature public disclosure may be a disservice to the industry I agree to 
    refrain from either directly or indirectly making any public disclosure of the business transacted 
    by the Committee without the express consent of the Committee Chair and the Standards Vice-President.
  • That recording of meetings (except by the Secretary as permitted by the 
  SMPTE Standards Operations Manual) is prohibited, and if, when available, I choose to attend 
    meetings by electronic means this same prohibition applies.
