    <h2>Participation Agreement</h2>
    <p>By submitting this application I understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That on approval of my application I will be permitted to join any number of SMPTE Technology Committees and their subgroups;</li>
      <li>• That my initial status on each Technology Committee will be that of Observer Member, but that after attending one or more meetings I may apply to the Technology Committee Chair for Participant Member status on that Technology Committee;</li>
      <li>• That Participant Membership in any Technology Committee requires regular attendance at meetings and regular articipation in formal ballots of the committee;</li>
      <li>• That membership of the SMPTE Standards Community requires a single working email address for all committee communications, and access to the Internet for obtaining documents, participation in committee ballots, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I acknowledge and agree:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To be governed by the <a href="#bib-smpte-bylaws"></a></li>
      <li>That I will adhere to the provisions of the SMPTE Operations Manuals applicable to Engineering Committees (available at <a>https://www.smpte.org/about/policies-and-governance</a>), specifically the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual-v31"></a> and the Intellectual Property Policy included therein and, following notification of any adoption or change, such rules and policies as the Board of Directors and/or the SMPTE Standards Committee may from time to time adopt.</li>
      <li>That on-going participation in Committee activities constitutes an agreement to be bound by any amendment(s) in <a href="#bib-smpte-bylaws"></a>, <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual-v31"></a>, rules and/or policies that are made from time to time. Such adoptions, amendments and changes in policies will be communicated to me by email to the address I provide for Committee communications at least 30 days before the effective date of the change.</li>
      <li>That I may be participating in issues relating to the on-going appraisal of technologies, and in decisions that are interim by nature and may undergo substantial revisions. I recognize that SMPTE encourages me to discuss such issues privately with others considered to be knowledgeable in the field. However, since premature public disclosure may be a disservice to the industry I agree to refrain from either directly or indirectly making any public disclosure of the business transacted by the Committee without the express consent of the Committee Chair and the Standards Vice-President.</li>
      <li>That recording of meetings (except by the Secretary as permitted by the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual-v31"></a>) is prohibited, and if, when available, I choose to attend meetings by electronic means this same prohibition applies.</li>
    </ul>
